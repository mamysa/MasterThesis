\section{Testing}

To test PyPltRedex, two forms testing is employed: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Unit testing form most non-trivial transformation / analysis passes.
\item Integration tests containing \texttt{redex-match-assert-equal}, \texttt{term-let-assert-equal}, \texttt{apply-reduction-relation-assert-equal} forms that test functionality of pattern matching, term-generation and application of reduction relations and metafunctions. Some tests cases were lifted from testing suite that comes with PLTRedex. All test cases use output of PLTRedex for comparison.
\end{enumerate}
